# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game/Frontend Mentor Advanced Challenge

It's a frontend mentor advanced challenge. If you want to join this challenge the frontend mentor gives you an [empty template](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rock-paper-scissors-game-pTgwgvgH). This challenge can really help you to sharpen your front-end skills!

Additionally I've created this project following by [Florin Pop](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeU-1X402kT-JlLdAitxSMA) youtube channel.
